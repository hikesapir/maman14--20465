# Assembly Language Project - 20465: System Programming Lab

This is an assembly language project developed for the course "20465 - System Programming Lab" at  The Open University. The project involves creating an assembler for a custom assembly language, which processes assembly code files, extracts symbols and commands, validates and processes the code, and generates corresponding output files.

## Overview

The project aims to create an assembler for the custom assembly language used in the course "20465 - System Programming Lab." The assembler performs the following main tasks:
- Validates input assembly code files.
- Strips macros from the code.
- Extracts symbols and commands from the code.
- Validates symbols and commands for correctness.
- Generates output files including symbol entries, external symbols, and encoded commands.
